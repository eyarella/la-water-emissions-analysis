# la-water-emissions-analysis
Exploratory analysis of Los Angeles building data focusing on water usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and trends over time using R.

This project analyzes building-level data from Los Angeles to explore trends in water usage and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions over time. Using R, the project includes data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis to better understand the environmental impact of LA’s built environment.

## 📊 Objectives
- Investigate water consumption patterns in Los Angeles buildings
- Analyze CO₂ emissions over time by building year/type
- Visualize trends and correlations using R (ggplot2, dplyr, etc.)

## 🧰 Tools Used
- R
- tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)
- lubridate
- readr
- scales
- RMarkdown 
## 📁 Contents
- `data/` – raw data (CSV file)
- `scripts/` – R scripts for cleaning, analysis, and plotting
- `figures/` – Output graphs and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 📈 Data Source
